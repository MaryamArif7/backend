    What is Cors issue?
    ->when a web appliaction running in one origin attempt to acess
    recources from differen torigin(domain,protocol,port) ,sever doesnt allow it directly
    How to solve?

    ->1 ->The method below is the 1st solution ,by putting which domain we wnat to allow
    in this case it will be the frontend domain ,the origin will be the fronent link
    2->we can allow origins by putting * ->basically known as wild card

1->express.json()->built in middleware function that parses incoming requests

->basiaccly without express.json ,express will ot parse
the incoming requets as json.Without this ,if the server recive a req with json data
it wont be able to acess that data ,so to convert that data from json to js obj
->form submiited->in json format->to the network as the body of the HTTP req->on server side ->middleware aceepts the incopming req as json bodies and coverts ot js obj
